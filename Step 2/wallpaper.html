            <h2>Model x</h2>
            <p>During the mid-20th century, there was plenty of speculation that we’d all have flying cars by now, so it’s understandable if you’re disappointed by our lack of progress in that area. But there is a lot of incredibly cool technology available in cars right now that engineers in 1950 could hardly have dreamed of. We’re taking steps toward fully autonomous vehicles, we’re driving electric supercars, we’re talking to our cars – and they respond. 

                You don’t have to pay six-figure prices for the features that will eventually enable self-driving cars, advanced car safety features, and other forward-thinking tech. Many of the most amazing features can be found in reasonably affordable models, though it does usually require adding a package or upgrading the trim level. The following slides highlight mainstream cars with great new tech features, and on each slide, we’ve included the lowest price for the vehicle equipped with the technology described. As you read, keep in mind that the scores you see here might not exactly match the scores in our reviews. That’s because our reviews are updated whenever new information becomes available.</p>

            <h2>Model Y</h2>
            <p>The 2021 Hyundai Sonata sedan comes packed with standard technology, making it a formidable competitor in the midsize car class, but to get the really cool stuff, step up to the tech-filled, top-end Limited trim for about $10,000 more than the base price. That’s where you’ll find the remote parking assist feature. The Sonata can pull into and out of a parking space at the touch of a button – you don’t even have to be in the driver’s seat. 

                The Limited and SEL trims also have blind spot monitoring, which is a common safety feature. But the Sonata’s safety system one-ups rivals with a camera that displays an image of your blind spot in the instrument cluster when you turn on your signal to change lanes.</p>

            <h2>Model XY</h2>
            <P>
                Let’s be honest – everything about the 2020 Porsche Taycan luxury electric car is cool. This sleek sedan looks amazing and it’s blisteringly quick. The noteworthy tech is not nearly as sexy, but matters a lot: charging time. The Taycan uses an 800-volt electrical system, which means it’s able to charge twice as fast as a Tesla. It’s possible to go from an 8% charge to an 80% charge in just 20 minutes at a DC fast charger.

            <h2>Model Z</h2>
            <P>
                The all-new 2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime brings plug-in hybrid technology to Toyota’s popular compact SUV. The RAV4 Prime can drive up to 40 miles on electricity alone before using the engine in a more traditional hybrid setup. To get the most out of those all-electric miles, the available Predictive Efficient Drive uses driver habits, GPS data, the navigation system, and traffic information to optimize the gas and electric mix for efficiency. 

To get navigation, which the system needs to figure out your route and traffic, you’ll need to add the navigation package, which costs $2,435, to the top XSE trim.
